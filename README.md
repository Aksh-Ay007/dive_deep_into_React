# React Rev

This project demonstrates how to use React's `createElement` API to build nested elements and render them to the DOM using `ReactDOM.createRoot`.

## How It Works

- The main logic is in [app.js](app.js), where React elements are created manually using `React.createElement`.
- Nested elements are represented as arrays of children, allowing for complex component structures.
- The root element is rendered into the `<div id="root">` in [index.html](index.html) using `root.render(parent)`.

## Custom React Setup

Unlike projects created with the official `create-react-app` command, this setup is fully manual. You configured everything yourself:
- Created your own HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- Installed React and ReactDOM as dependencies.
- Used Parcel as the bundler for fast development and optimized builds.
- Built React elements manually and rendered them using React 18's root API.

This approach gives you more control and a deeper understanding of how React works under the hood.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Sets up the HTML structure and loads React, ReactDOM, and the main script.
- **app.js**: Contains the React element creation and rendering logic.
- **index.css**: Provides basic styling for the parent and child elements.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Example

The following code from [app.js](app.js) creates a parent `<div>` with two child `<div>`s, each containing two `<h1>` elements:

```js
let parent = React.createElement("div", { id: "parent" }, [
  React.createElement("div", { id: "child1" }, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "iam first child"),
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "iam second child"),
  ]),
  React.createElement("div", { id: "child2" }, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "iam first child"),
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "iam second child"),
  ]),
]);
```

## Parcel Features

- **Dev build**
- **Local server creation**
- **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)** – algorithm written in C++
- **Caching** – faster builds
- **Image optimization**
- **Minification**
- **Bundling**
- **Compression**
- **Consistent hashing**
- **Code splitting**
- **Differential bundling** – supports older browsers
- **Tree shaking** – removes unused code

## Why Is This App So Fast?

This React project is fast because it leverages the latest React rendering engine (React 18+) and uses efficient DOM updates. React's virtual DOM minimizes direct manipulation of the browser DOM, only updating what has changed. This results in smoother performance and less resource usage, especially for complex UIs.

Additionally, the project uses Parcel as a bundler, which provides lightning-fast development builds and hot module replacement. Parcel automatically optimizes your code and assets, so changes are reflected instantly in the browser without a full reload.

## How React Improves Performance

- **Virtual DOM:** React creates a lightweight copy of the actual DOM and only updates the parts that change, reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- **Concurrent Rendering:** React 18 introduces concurrent features, allowing React to prepare multiple UI updates in the background and apply them efficiently.
- **Efficient Bundling:** Parcel bundles and serves your files quickly, optimizing for both development and production.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (if using npm):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npx parcel index.html
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` (default Parcel port).
